**[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)** (data build tool) enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their warehouses by simply writing select statements.

These select statements, or "models", form a dbt project. These models frequently build on top of one another - dbt makes it easy to [manage relationships](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference#ref) between models, and [visualize these relationships](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/documentation), as well as assure the quality of your transformations through [testing](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/testing).

dbt projects are used to [aggregate pageviews into sessions](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/snowplow), calculate [ad spend ROI](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/facebook-ads), or report on [email campaign performance](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/mailchimp).
